** Selected Columns of the Density Matrix **
This repository contains MATLAB code for the Selected Columns of the Density Matrix (SCDM) suite of algorithms and includes the routines necessary to use the SCDM method in conjunction with the [Wannier90](www.wannier.org) software package.

** Contents **
The examples folder contains documentation, example input files, and an annotated work-flow that illustrates using this code with QuantumESPRESSO and Wannier90 to perform band interpolation.
