Example workflow for using this interface

An explict example is inclued in the examples directory. This includes example input files for Wannier90 and the SCDM Matlab code.


1) Run QuantumESPRESSO SCF calculation 

2) Run Wannier90 to generate input files from .win file

3) Run PW2Wannier to generate UNK files (output orbitals)

4) Run SCDM Matlab code to generate desired .amn file

	- example input files are given for all the supported cases (isolated and entangled)

5) Run Run Wannier90 with or without any iterations

6) Use Geninterp routines from postw90 to perform band structure interpolation on the desired grid. 

	- gen_kpts.m may be used to generate paths through the  Brillouin Zone and the required .dat file.
